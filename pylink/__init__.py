"""Link Budget Management in Python

This package provides a flexible system with which to build and solve
any Directed Acyclic Graph data model.  The design objective is to
hide the complexity of calculation in discrete segments all registered
through a simple central interface.  See the package README for more
details, the examples directory in the source code for how to use it.
